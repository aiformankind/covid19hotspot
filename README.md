# Welcome to Covid-19 Hotspots Project

It would be great if we have a map of Covid-19 hotspots and symptoms across every zipcode in the United States. Many people have voiced their desire to find out these hotspots for various reasons. This service is built to crowdsource Covid-19 symptoms information from public to build out this hotspot map. The data collected could potentially be used by researchers in understanding the spread.

## Text us your symptoms and zipcode to 415-200-2449
### Example: Fever, Dry Cough 95051

### [Data collected will be shown here](hotspot.md)

Thank you for helping our community in this time of need.
